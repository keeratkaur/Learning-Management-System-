# Learning-Management-System-
The Learning Management System developed on Jupyter Notebook is a user-friendly platform designed to facilitate online learning and course management. This system is built with Python, leveraging the interactivity and flexibility provided by Jupyter Notebook to create an educational environment that is both accessible and powerful.

The LMS is built to handle multiple roles—Admin, Teacher, and Student—each with specific access permissions, ensuring that users can only perform actions relevant to their role.

## User Management:

Role-Based Login: Users can select their role (Admin, Teacher, or Student) and log in with their username. The system restricts access to functionalities based on the selected role.
User Registration: New users can be registered through the system, allowing them to select a role and gain access to appropriate features.

## Course Management:

Course Creation: Teachers and Admins can create new courses by providing titles and other relevant details.
Enrollment: Students can enrol in available courses, while Teachers can manage course enrollments.

Content Management: Teachers can add content to their courses, such as lecture notes, assignments, and other materials. However, access is restricted based on roles, ensuring unauthorized users (e.g., students) cannot modify course content.

## Communication:

Messaging System: The application includes a messaging system where students and teachers can communicate directly. This feature facilitates discussion, queries, and feedback, enhancing the learning experience.
Message Reading: Users can read incoming messages, keeping them informed and engaged with course activities.

## Security and Access Control:

Permission Management: The system enforces role-based permissions, ensuring that users can only access and modify data that is relevant to their role. For example, a Teacher attempting to perform an Admin-specific action will receive a "Permission Denied" alert.
Content Accessibility: Only authorized users can view and manage course content, preventing data breaches and unauthorized access.

# Conclusion:
This Learning Management System provides a secure and structured environment for managing courses and user interactions within an educational setting. Implementing role-based access control enhances security, making the system suitable for schools, colleges, and other institutions requiring a robust LMS.
